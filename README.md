# DataScience-LinearRegression

Using Multiple Linear Regression in order to model the deman for shared bikes.
Need to understand the factors affecting the demand for the shared bbikes in the American Market.

It answers:
  - Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes
  - How well those variables describe the bike demand

Understanding this will help in coming up with a business strategy to meet the demand levels and the cutomer's expectation. 


The process used here is:
1. Data Cleaning
2. EDA - as detailed [here](https://github.com/saigeethamn/DataSciencePreReq-EDA)
3. Data Preparation for Modelling
    - Create Dummy Variables for multi-level categorical variables
    - Sclaing features (non-categorical)
4. Feature Selection through a balance approach betwen RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination) and backward approach
5. Build the model
6. Validate the Linear Regression Assumptions
7. Make Predictions
8. Draw Inferences from the model
